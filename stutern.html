    <h1>Hello World </h1>
    <h2> This is my first website</h2>
    <h3> Feels pretty easy so far</h3>
    <h4> Hope it continues like this.</h4>

    <pre> 
    I have always had the feeling that coding was hard but going by my experience so far 
    it's looking pretty easy. Look forward to doing amazing things sooner than I thought.
    Getting a scholarship at stutern has opened up my mind to more possibilities in the tech space. 
    Anything is doable as long as my heart is in it.
